    <h1>High Dimensional Optimisation Using Evolutionary Methods</h1>
    <h2>A guide to evolutionary optimisation and other naturally inspired methods used in machine learning.</h2>
    <dt-byline></dt-byline>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Evolutionary optimisation takes inspiration from nature and the notion of survival of the fittest to find a optimal solution in an often high dimensional search space. These implementations vary in thier resemblance to reality ranging from merely selecting the best option from a population to replicating the entire evolutionary mechanism right down to implementing crude chromosomes.

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>
        To introduce the basic principles of evolutionary optimisation let's take a look at a simple example at how a population collectively nears an optimal solution to a problem. In this example, a group of organisms each with just 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a> (units of DNA) evolve to emulate a target organism that we can define. Luckily for us, each nucleotide can be encoded as a value from 0 to 1 and are continuous. This means that a 0.5 nucleotide is closer to a 0.6 nucleotide than a 0.3 one. To store this data, we could use a 2D array of dimensions \(N*5\) where \(N\) is the population size.
    </p>
    <h3>The Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Population:</b> This involves creating a population \(X\) of size \(N\) of organisms each with random nucleotide values. This may look as follows:
        \[X = \begin{array}{11}
                    \{\{0.529, 0.358, 0.692, 0.492, 0.849\},\\
                  \;\;\{0.063, 0.914, 0.256, 0.252, 0.275\},\\
            \qquad\;\;\{0.629, 0.042, 0.753, 0.737, 0.945\}, ...\}\end{array}\]</li>
        <li><b>Evaluation:</b> This requires us to first determine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness function</a> \(f\). This will enable us to determine how useful a given organism is to our population and hence worthy of reproduction. As we are trying to get each organism \(x\) to emulate our goal organism \(g\) we need could determine the "distance" from \(x\) to \(g\). We could do this by thinking of each organism as a point in 5 dimensional space, with each nucleotide value a coordinate for thier location. Using this abstraction we can use pythagoras' theorem to determine the distance between each organism. <br><br>
